# Hand-Gesture-Draving-Tool
This Python desktop application creates a real-time drawing tool. Using your webcam and MediaPipe, it lets you draw by forming a pinch gesture with your thumb and index finger. The app tracks your fingertip and draws a continuous line, green for your left hand and red for your right. A fist gesture will clear the screen.
